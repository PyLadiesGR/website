## PyLadies Grand Rapids
We are a group of developers who love the Python programming language. We write code by day or night. Some of us hack on Python projects on the side, while others work with it full-time. Some are just starting out in programming, while others have years of experience.

But it doesn't matter.

We all just like writing Python code, and that's what brings us together.

## Goals

* Organize events that facilitate professional development of our members
* Inspire more people from under-represented groups to fall in love with programming & support and mentor them on their journey
* Build a revolving community: students become mentors
* Create a safe, non-threatening environment in the local tech communities
