## Coffee, Code, Repeat

Because our workshop from the previous years were such a success we did a lot of the same things for this year. You can read [more about that here](https://grandrapids.pyladies.com/post/django-girls-2018/).

Pita House catered our lunch again this year, and again they didn't disappoint.

Our organizers, coaches, and attendees came with energy, enthusiasm, and positive attitudes.

## Swag
We loved the color theme and designs from last year so kept our "Code with Kindness" theme. All of our attendees got a pink t-shirt with navy "Code with Kindness" on it. As a thank you to the hard-working the coaches, we not only gave the them a t-shirt, but also a navy hoodie with pink logo on it.

## Photos!
[Bryan Esler](https://www.bryanesler.com/), our photographer from last year, was so inspired by our event that he offered his in-kind sponsorship this year. He provided headshots for all coaches and participants as well as event photos. We loved how all of the photos came out. Thanks Bryan!
