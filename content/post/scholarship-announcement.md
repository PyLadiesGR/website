PyLadies Grand Rapids is excited to announce Represent!, our scholarship program, to support and empower people from under-represented groups aspiring to become professional software engineers.

## About our Represent! scholarship winner
Claire is a former middle school teacher turned programmer. One of her first programming experiences was through this year's [Django Girls Workshop](http://grandrapids.pyladies.com/post/django-girls-2018/). After her positive experiences at the 2 day workshop, she decided to take the leap and enrolled in [Grand Circus's Front-end Bootcamp](https://www.grandcircus.co/grand-rapids-coding-bootcamp/) this spring. She's thrilled to have this new opportunity and is excited for the new "branch" in her journey into the tech field!

## PyLadies

We are an international mentorship group with a focus on helping more women become active participants and leaders in the Python open-source community. Our mission is to promote, educate and advance a diverse Python community through outreach, education, conferences, events and social gatherings.

PyLadies also aims to provide a friendly support network for women and a bridge to the larger Python world. Anyone with an interest in Python is encouraged to participate!

## PyLadies Grand Rapids Goals

* To help increase the presence of women and individuals from underrepresented groups in the tech field
* To create a safe, non-threatening environment in the local tech communities
* To build a self-sustainable community where students become mentors

## About the Scholarship

Our recent [Django Girls Workshop](http://grandrapids.pyladies.com/post/django-girls-2018/) was such a success and inspired so many people that an anonymous donor wanted to continue building this energy of the workshop. They stepped up to donate funds to support our members on their programming journeys. A huge thank you to this person, and all those that give back to our community.

Recipients will be required to write a summary about their experience, what they used the scholarship for, and how it benefited them.
