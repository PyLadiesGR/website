## About the Scholarship

Our recent [Django Girls Workshop](http://grandrapids.pyladies.com/post/django-girls-2018/) was such a success and inspired so many people that an annonymous donor wanted to continue this energy and support after the workshop as well. They stepped up to donate funds to support one of our members on their programming journey. A huge thank you to this person, and all those that give back to our community.
