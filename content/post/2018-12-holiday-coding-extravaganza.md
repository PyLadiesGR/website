PyLadies Grand Rapids was invited to participate in the Holiday Coding Extravaganza event for Saturday, December 1st 9am - 1pm. There will be free intro to coding workshops for all ages throughout the morning.

In trying to make this event as accessible as possible, Grand Circus has arranged activities for the younger programmers-to-be (age 5+) while you particpate in the mornings coding activities.

PyLadies will be holding our regularly scheduled coffee and code meetup at this event as well. So if the workshops aren't you're thing, join us to hack away on a project, do a tutorial or to join in a discussion about programming.

If you'd like to participate in the workshops please [Check the event site for details](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/intro-to-coding-holiday-extravaganza-in-grand-rapids-tickets-51359763435).
