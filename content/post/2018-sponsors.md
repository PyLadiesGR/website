We'd also like to thank our new sponsors this year: [Jet Brains](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), [Citizen Labs](https://citizenlabs.org/), [BoxBoom](http://boxboomcreative.com/), [Start Garden](http://startgarden.com/), and [Grand River Bank](https://www.grandriverbank.com/) for joining us for our second annual Django Girls Workshop.
