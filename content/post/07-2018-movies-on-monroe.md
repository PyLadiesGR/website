## What is Movies on Monroe?

"Movies on Monroe, formerly Movies in the Park, is the premier outdoor film series in Grand Rapids. DGRI and partners present films - free of charge - on a giant video wall along the banks of the Grand River every other Friday from June thru August. Guests are invited to treat the evening like a picnic and bring your own blanket, chairs, beer, wine and snacks for a special night under the stars. Gates open at 6:00 PM. Pre-movie entertainment begins at 6:30 PM. First film starts at 7: 30 PM followed by an additional feature shortly after the first ends."

PyLadies Grand Rapids was asked to participate in the Movies on Monroe event for [Friday, August 3rd](https://www.facebook.com/events/649703678696560/). The movies playing for this even will be Shrek and Hidden Figures, as such the organizers thought it would be a great event to promote women in tech.

We, along with other local organizations, will have a booth to promote our organization and show support for any potential future programmers at the event.

So we'd like you to join us at the event to show your support as well, or go for the great movies!

Come say hi to us at our booth! :wave:
