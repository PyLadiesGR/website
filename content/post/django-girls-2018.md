## Numbers

After a very successful first workshop in 2017, we decided to put on another Django Girls workshop on March 9th - 10th at Start Garden:

* 34 attendees
* 16 sponsors
* 14 coaches
* 6 organizers
* a ton of supportive friends
* = An Awesome Workshop

## Coffee, Code, Repeat

Because our workshop from the previous year was such a success we did a lot of the same things for this year. You can read [more about that here](https://medium.com/@Rachell/a-little-back-story-a6a9d8f8be5).

Pita House catered our lunch again this year, and again they didn't disappoint.

Our organizers, coaches, and attendees came with energy, enthusiasm, and positive attitudes.

Three of our attendees from last year joined us as coaches and one as an organizer this year. Laila gave an inspiration talk about her journey into programming and becoming a front end developer.

Rachell inspired the attendees with the challenges and successes of her journey from English Teacher to Django Developer.

## Fresh
We wanted a fresh new design, so sticking with this years Django Girls Foundation's theme, we also decided to use 'Code with Kindness'. [Little Space Studio](http://www.littlespacestudio.com/) sponsored the designs for our swag again this year, and they turned out great!

[Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/) sponsored our photography this year, which included headshots for anyone participating in the workshop. Attendees and coaches alike seemed to really appreciate this service.
