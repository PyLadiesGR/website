      <description>Django Girls GR at PyCon Django Girls Grand Rapids was honored to be asked to manage the Django Girls booth at PyCon in Cleveland, Ohio this year. Because of our participation, we were able to sponsor two volunteers&amp;rsquo; tickets to PyCon that might not otherwise been able to go.
There were three people total that volunteered to help out with the booth. They spent days up to the event preparing, and 3 days at the booth answering questions, inspiring new organizers, and showing PyCon how to have a fun booth.</description>
