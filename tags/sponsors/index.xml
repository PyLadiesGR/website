      <description>Thank you! We are overwhelmed with the generosity of all of our sponsors this year. A shout out to Toptal, Blue Medora, Little Space Studio, Python Software Foundation, Software GR, Stoneburner Video, Zapier, and StickerMule who were all more than happy to step up as sponsors for a second year in a row.
We&amp;rsquo;d also like to thank our new sponsors this year: Jet Brains, Citizen Labs, BoxBoom, Start Garden, and Grand River Bank for joining us for our second annual Django Girls Workshop.</description>
